SPRINT 1: Low Hanging Fruit - Refactoring
+ daemonize code and start on install/restart; optify - 3pt
+ https -> http problem with amazon - 1pt
+ rm displayed client/server bits of username check-in - 1pt
+ Very basic client check that clock is > some current date
+ Better server polling for changes in signature files: use
  if-modified-since; and we only poll for places that we are actually
  using or should be using according to our seen macs (using
  touch/untouch).
+ Binder clears its scan list as well when movement is detected (so
  scans from another place are not included in the bind).
- refactor client into like local socket daemon, but don't define API
  yet - 3pt
- Check again for memory leaks - 1pt
- walk detector experiment


SPRINT 2: Local Socket API
- implement local socket API - 3pt
- Do fetch soon after doing a bind - 1pt
- Scan slower and stop network updates when idle - 1pt
- Client should work in different network availability environments
  Test binding when wifi turned off and only 3g is available


SPRINT 3:
- automatic binds - 3pt
- icon: compass in/over a building?  over stata?
- Sense if no network connection and work in background if so - 3pt

SPRINT -Unassigned
- Periodic Statistics sent from client and recorded appropriately - 3pt

- Privacy Policy and Terms of Service
  User needs to accept terms when installing software on install.
  Might not ever use Binder, so needs to accept when install.
  Need to create terms and policy with Legal.
  But terms only apply when directing to Nokia servers. - 5pt

- Reliability and Alarms
  As a user, the regular system should be available most of the time:
  DOD: A server-side alert system is put in place to monitor the two
  components - 5pt

- Filter bad client info: add regex filter for bad bssids sent to
  server - 1pt

- apply scans locally first - 3pt

- "fillAreaCache:631 - loop through results" -- we seem to be adding
  and then dropping results too frequently - 3pt

- Remove virtual APs / reduce each AP to one real one - 3pt

- User should be able to reset and clean cache
  Cache should be placed in correct place in Ubuntu and Maemo
  (optification)
  Base this on a global configuration file - 1pt
 
- Bigger feedback window - 1pt

- Enforce clean entry submission
  If you set the binder inputs to a value, then start activates, but
  then if you delete the entry without hitting enter, you can still
  click start and submit a blank entry - 3pt

- Reflect local area coverage to user - 3pt
