Mole Web Service Client and Server TODO

- scale/normalize score provided in query results

- shorted time for scanning (do several scans in quick succession)

If desired:
- improve output of query results
- improve the persistence of the db
- server does pre-screening of containers based on mac union
- use device type to segment scans
