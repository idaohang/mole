Mole Web Service Client and Server TODO

Week of Jan 9:
+ using MT vm and Lenovo
+ get full loop of scanner daemon + mole-ws working, possibly (should)
  work against a local server; currently getting NPE in server; check
  that json send with daemon's scans is the same as without using this.
+ improve output of query results through new class using QJson::QObjectHelper::qvariant2qobject
+ change simpleScanQueue size back to normal
+ improve output of query results through new class
+ test other components (binder, daemon, cli)
  + Fixed moled not talking to binder via dbus
  + Installed QtCreator w/Maemo on MT vm
  + Fixed problem when scanner-daemon is daemonized.
+ test restarting server after bind
+ test that fresh compilation works
  + tested only on ubuntu, 
+ see publish option in qtcreator
  + unsuccessful due to qt creator not seeming to work properly; aborting
- test accelerometer
- create new maemo and linux packages

Future improvements:
- scale/normalize score provided in query results
- shorten time for scanning (do several scans in quick succession)

If desired:
- improve the persistence of the db
- server does pre-screening of containers based on mac union
- use device type to segment scans

Potential problem when comparing a room with a bind with many scans to one with few.
Let device build up 15 scans in room 313 (current scan queue size).  Did bind with two scans in 311 (on empty database).
For device in 311, result is now:
[c="4CC", p="313", pr=0.00293387]
