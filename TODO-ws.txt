Mole Web Service Client and Server TODO

Week of Jan 9:
+ using MT vm and Lenovo
+ get full loop of scanner daemon + mole-ws working, possibly (should)
  work against a local server; currently getting NPE in server; check
  that json send with daemon's scans is the same as without using this.
+ improve output of query results through new class using QJson::QObjectHelper::qvariant2qobject
+ change simpleScanQueue size back to normal
+ improve output of query results through new class
+ test other components (binder, daemon, cli)
  + Fixed moled not talking to binder via dbus
  + Installed QtCreator w/Maemo on MT vm
  + Fixed problem when scanner-daemon is daemonized.
+ test restarting server after bind
+ test that fresh compilation works
  + tested only on ubuntu, 
+ see publish option in qtcreator
  + unsuccessful due to qt creator not seeming to work properly; aborting
- test accelerometer
- create new maemo and linux packages

Future improvements:
- scale/normalize score provided in query results
- shorten time for scanning (do several scans in quick succession)

If desired:
- improve the persistence of the db
- server does pre-screening of containers based on mac union
- use device type to segment scans

- Server Upgrades
  - http://download.eclipse.org/jetty/
  - consider switching from Gson to Jackson
  - Hide latency of talking to Dynamo by checking json serialization and then returning OK to client.
