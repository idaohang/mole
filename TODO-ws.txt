Mole Web Service Client and Server TODO

Week of Jan 9:
+ using MT vm and Lenovo
+ get full loop of scanner daemon + mole-ws working, possibly (should)
  work against a local server; currently getting NPE in server; check
  that json send with daemon's scans is the same as without using this.
+ improve output of query results through new class using QJson::QObjectHelper::qvariant2qobject
+ change simpleScanQueue size back to normal
+ improve output of query results through new class
- test other components (binder, daemon, cli)
  - Leaving off: moled not talking to binder via dbus
- test accelerometer
  - Installed QtCreator w/Maemo on MT vm
- test that fresh compilation works
- create new maemo and linux packages

Future improvements:
- scale/normalize score provided in query results
- shorten time for scanning (do several scans in quick succession)

If desired:
- improve the persistence of the db
- server does pre-screening of containers based on mac union
- use device type to segment scans
