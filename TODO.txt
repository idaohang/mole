SPRINT 1: Low Hanging Fruit - Refactoring
April 18-30; Completed 14 pts
+ daemonize code and start on install/restart; optify - 3pt
+ https -> http problem with amazon - 1pt
+ rm displayed client/server bits of username check-in - 1pt
+ Very basic client check that clock is > some current date - 1pt
+ Better server polling for changes in signature files: use
  if-modified-since; and we only poll for places that we are actually
  using or should be using according to our seen macs (using
  touch/untouch) - 3pt
+ Binder clears its scan list as well when movement is detected (so
  scans from another place are not included in the bind) - 1pt
+ walk detector experiment - 3pts
+ Do fetch soon after doing a bind - 1pt

SPRINT 1.5:
+ on client when using local server: 
  map in put in: /opt/var/lib/map/sachusetts/Cambridge/4\ Cambridge\
  Center/sig.xml; USA/Ma is truncated - 1pt
+ Eliminate/merge duplicate MACs that are part of the same scan

SPRINT 2: June 13 - July 7 (v0.4)
- major rewrite of internals in order to reduce memory and cpu:
   scanQueue and histogram rewrite - 11pt
   Still to-do after seven days: 
   + act after motion detected
   + stats shown in UI
   + binding: did short (9 scan) and long (60 scan) binds
   + with maxActiveQueueLength
   - clean out excess qDebugs
   - re-check memory usage
   - test vs existing version
+ Device/WiFi name sent properly - 1pt
+ icons: compass in/over a building?  over stata- 3pt
+ implement local socket API - 3pt
+ Filter bad client info: add regex filter for bad bssids sent to
  server - 1pt

SPRINT 3: (v0.5)
- Command line mole-binder: bind (place=, tags=), query, stat; needs
to respond if not; DO THIS SOON because no telnet on tablets
- Apply binds to local database - 3pt
- Test binding multiple nearby buildings
- "unbind" to remove spaces
- Web page with instructions - 3pt
+ Refactor DBus so that not included with Symbian - 1pt
- Check again for memory leaks - 1pt

ALPHA RELEASE 

SPRINT 4:

- Offline mode: sense if no network connection and stop network
   activity if so; reactivate when changes - 3pt
- Scan slower and stop network updates when idle - 3pt
- Check again for memory leaks - 3pt


POST-RELEASE
- Better motion detection - 3pt
- Periodic Statistics sent from client and recorded appropriately - 3pt
- Comment out qDebug statements via some good method (#define ?) - 1pt
- refactor client into like local socket daemon, but don't define API
  yet - 3pt
- Client should work in different network availability environments
   Test binding when wifi turned off and only 3g is available


SPRINT -Unassigned

- Reliability and Alarms
  As a user, the regular system should be available most of the time:
  DOD: A server-side alert system is put in place to monitor the two
  components - 5pt

- Builder eliminates spaces (happens rarely)
  In an INdT exp, after a bind, it appears that the builder only
  outputted signatures for a subset of the spaces it should have.
  Specifically, the correct space (R20) was transiently ommitted from
  the area's set of signatures.  When another bind was done and the
  signature map was created again, the correct space re-appeared and
  the correct space was chosen.  The change is to put logging in the
  Builder to watch for "forgetting" of a space.


- Better icons, e.g. in control (package installer)

- "fillAreaCache:631 - loop through results" -- we seem to be adding
  and then dropping results too frequently - 3pt

- Remove virtual APs / reduce each AP to one real one; see email from Jun-geun on hack for how to do this (May 4 2011) - 3pt
- Screen out mobile/transient MACs as described in UCLA SenSys paper.
  Looked briefly at this and mobile/transient MACs did not appear in
  scan results, so maybe this doesn't need to happen - 1pt

- User should be able to reset and clean cache
  Cache should be placed in correct place in Ubuntu and Maemo
  (optification)
  Base this on a global configuration file - 1pt
 
- Bigger feedback window - 1pt

- Enforce clean entry submission
  If you set the binder inputs to a value, then start activates, but
  then if you delete the entry without hitting enter, you can still
  click start and submit a blank entry - 3pt

- Reflect local area coverage to user - 3pt
